🚀 **Built an Android App Using Expo + React Native | Side Project** 🏏📱

As a **DevOps Engineer**, I usually work on cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and automation. Recently, due to the unavailability of an Android developer, I took up a challenge to **design, build, debug, and package a complete Android application from scratch**.

### 📱 Project: **Avatar’s Gali Cricket App**

A lightweight Android app designed to manage **local (gali) cricket matches**, built with a **production-oriented architecture**.

### 🔧 Technical Highlights:

* **React Native (Expo)** for cross-platform development
* **Modular screen-based architecture**
* **Bottom Tabs + Nested Top Tabs navigation**
* **Local persistence using AsyncStorage**
* **State-driven UI for real-time score updates**
* **Team management logic (5 vs 5, dynamic swaps)**
* **Finance dashboard** (contribution, expense, balance)
* **Offline-first design**
* **EAS Build** for Android APK/AAB packaging

### 🧠 Key Learnings:

* Mobile app lifecycle & navigation patterns
* Debugging Metro bundler & dependency issues
* Managing environment compatibility (Node, Expo CLI)
* Packaging and testing production-ready Android builds

This project reinforced my belief that **good engineers can adapt across stacks** when required.
Happy to receive feedback or ideas for future enhancements.
